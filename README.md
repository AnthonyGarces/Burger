The purpose of this app is to give users the option to write out a hamburger of their choosing for eating. 

The app will send that request to a database, which will then display the selected burgers on the web page. 

The app will give users an option to "devour" the burger, updating the devoured status of the burger in the database, and displaying whether or not the burger has been eaten on the webpage.
